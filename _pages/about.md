### Life inspired by love and guided by knowledge - Bertrand Russell

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin,
working with Prof. [Vijay Chidambaram](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/) in the
[UT Systems and Storage Lab](http://utsaslab.cs.utexas.edu/) and the [LASR](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/lasr/) 
research group. I am also closely working with [Kimberly Keeton](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=wR_tv-kAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Sharad Singhal](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=_CKGpJ0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), 
and [Marcos K. Aguilera](http://mkaguilera.kawazoe.org/).
I received my masters in Computer Science from [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/) 
(Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology), where I worked with Prof. [Sam H. Noh](http://next.unist.ac.kr/professor).

I am broadly interested in improving the performance and reliability of storage/file systems, operating systems, 
distributed systems, and database systems. Especially, my recent studies focus on designing an index structure 
and building a system based on Persistent Memory (PM). Currently, I am studying the design issues of index structures,
running on far memory architectures (e.g., an RDMA-enabled memory server or Gen-Z fabric-attached memory).
