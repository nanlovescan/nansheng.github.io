- As a researcher, I am devoted to developing and applying numerical and analytical tools to tackle complex challenges across science and engineering.
  My mathematical interests span numerical analysis, scientific computing, and mathematical physics.
  My interests in the natural sciences range from low-energy and high-energy physics to theoretical chemistry, materials science, and computational biology.
  My interests in engineering focus on quantum engineering, semicondutor engineering, control engineering, and materials design.

<!-- - I am an researcher committed to performing **numerical analysis** and developing **scientific computing** tools for problems arising in science and engineering.  -->

<!-- Specifically, I am an expert in interpreting fundamental theories, designing advanced and robust computational methods, as well as developing practical and sophisticated software to solve the **quantum many-body problem** and to predict the behaviors of matter of scientific and technological interest. For more details, please see the [Research](/research) page. -->

- I am a PhD student in Computational Mathematics at Stanford University, working with Prof. [Lexing Ying](https://web.stanford.edu/~lexing/). 
  I received my PhD degree in Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Chicago, where I worked with Prof. [Yuehaw Khoo](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~ykhoo). 
  I received my dual Bachelor's degree in Physics and Chemistry with highest honors from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I worked with Prof. [Tao Xiang](http://txiang-iphy.cn) and Prof. [Qiang Shi](http://159.226.64.165/web/qshi/prof.).

<!-- - I have collaborative connections with Dr. [Jason Kaye](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/jason-kaye), Dr. [Kun Chen](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/kun-chen-2) and Dr. [Olivier Parcollet](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/olivier-parcollet) at the Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation. -->
