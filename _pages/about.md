- I am an applied mathematician committed to performing **numerical analysis** and developing **scientific computing** tools for problems arising in science and engineering. Specifically, I am an expert in developing fundamental theories, advanced and robust computational methods, as well as practical and sophisticated software to solve the **quantum many-body problem** and to predict the behaviors of matter of scientific and technological interest. For more details, please see the [Research](/research) page.

- I am currently a graduate student in Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Chicago, working with Prof. [Yuehaw Khoo](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~ykhoo). I will be joining Stanford University as a graduate student in Computational and Mathematical Engineering this fall.

- I have collaborative connections with Dr. [Jason Kaye](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/jason-kaye), Dr. [Kun Chen](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/kun-chen-2), Dr. [Olivier Parcollet](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/olivier-parcollet), Dr. [Alexander Hampel](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/alexander-hampel), Dr. [Sophie Beck](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/sophie-beck) as well as Dr. [Nils Wentzell](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/nils-wentzell) at the Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation.

- I received my dual Bachelor's degree in Physics and Chemistry with highest honors from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I worked with Prof. [Tao Xiang](http://txiang-iphy.cn) and Prof. [Qiang Shi](http://159.226.64.165/web/qshi/prof.).

# Recent news

- I gave a talk at the Student Computational Math Seminar, the Ohio State University on the topic of [Introduction to Computational Quantum Physics](/files/talks/Talk_OSU_04_19_23.pdf) (04/21/23)!
- I will be joining Stanford University as a graduate student in Computational and Mathematical Engineering this fall (04/11/23)!
- I will be attending the [Modern Applied and Computational Analysis](https://icerm.brown.edu/topical_workshops/tw-23-maca/) workshop at Brown University during Jun 26 - 30, 2023 (04/21/23)! Look forward to meeting you there.
- The paper [Quantum Simulations of Fermionic Hamiltonians with Efficient Encoding and Ansatz Schemes](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c01119) has been published by Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation (2/15/23)! In this work we propose a computational protocol for quantum simulations of Fermionic Hamiltonians on a quantum computer.
- The paper [Low Rank Green's Function Representations Applied to Dynamical Mean-Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07764) has been posted to the Arxiv (01/18/23)! In this work we show that via a low rank decomposition, only 20-30 Matsubara frequency nodes are necessary for the Dyson equation solver of the dynamical mean-field theory, compared to 2000 which is typically used. Thanks to all of my collaborators at the Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation!
- The paper [Quantum Simulations of Fermionic Hamiltonians with Efficient Encoding and Ansatz Schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01912) has been posted to the Arxiv (12/04/22)! Focusing on quantum simulations of Fermionic Hamiltonians on a quantum computer, we show a substantial improvement in the scaling of circuit gate counts and a decrease in the number of required variational parameters.
- The paper [Quantum Embedding Theories to Simulate Condensed Systems on Quantum Computers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00279-0) has been published by Nature Computational Science (7/25/22)! It is aimed at discussing different embedding theories and the perspective for their simulations on quantum computers.
- I gave an exciting talk in the APS March meeting 2022 on solving the double counting issue in quantum defect embedding theory (3/15/22)! See the slides [here](/files/talks/Nan_Sheng_2022.pdf). I also contribute to Dr. Christian Vorwerk's talk on the application of the embedding theory to oxides. See the slides [here](/files/talks/Christian_Vorwerk_22.pdf).
- The paper [Green's Function Formulation of Quantum Defect Embedding Theory](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00240) has been published by Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation (6/1/2022)! It is aimed at solving the double counting issue in quantum defect embedding theory.
- I gave an exciting talk as the end of my experience (8/13/21)! See the slides [here](/files/talks/DLR%40CCQ.pdf). I will work remotely with colleagues to finish the project.
- I just start an internship at the Flatiron Institute, working with Dr. Olivier Parcollet, Dr. Jason Kaye and Dr. Kun Chen (6/3/21).
